- [ ] [DragHigh] Drag limit should depend on the size (mass) heavier should rotate slow.
      [LevelDifficulty] Beginning levels will be familiar to earth-brained and less violent.
- [ ] Gradient background (possibly dynamic) DARKGRAY to LIGHTGRAY
- [ ] Braid like time reversal.
- [x] Asteroids are also rigid bodies!
- [x] Drag only for high speeds, to give the feel of space. [:DragHigh]
- [x] Warping with half triangle renderings
- [x] Turning should have inertia and drag.
- [x] Movement from input


# Ideas

- [ ] [DragHigh] Since it feels tougher when the limits are high. [:LevelDifficulty] 
      Objects will become more sensitive and drag will reduce on higher levels. 
- [ ] [DragHigh] Release light/radiation when dragging for high speeds 
- [ ] Inner fill of the triangle changes to something opaque as speed increases
- [ ] Exhaust smokes, both for boost and for turning
- [ ] Since there is always cheat to simplify confusion of [LevelDifficulty]
      Higher difficulty levels will be first person, the world will rotate.
