# Goal

- Fun to code, not tiring 
- Fun to play, not jarring 
 

# TODO

- [ ] Goal should be to avoid asteroids, so
        Collision between ship and asteroid 
- [ ] Drag limit should depend on the size (mass) heavier should rotate slow. [DragClamp]
        Beginning levels will be familiar to earth-brained and less violent.  [LevelDifficulty]
- [ ] Gradient background (possibly dynamic) DARKGRAY to LIGHTGRAY
- [ ] Braid like time reversal.
- [x] Asteroids are also rigid bodies!
- [x] Drag only for high speeds, to give the feel of space.                   [:DragClamp]
- [x] Warping with half triangle renderings
- [x] Turning should have inertia and drag.
- [x] Movement from input
- [x] At high speeds ship should go straight, so                              [:HighSpeedStraight]
        Ship and Asteroid will have different angular drag, so  
        Ship should have an automatic breaking system                         [AutoBreak]


# Ideas

- [ ] Since it feels tougher when the limits are high.                        [:LevelDifficulty] [DragClamp] 
        Objects will become more sensitive and drag will reduce on higher levels. 
- [ ] Release light/radiation when dragging for high speeds                   [DragClamp] 
- [ ] Inner fill of the triangle changes to something opaque as speed increases
- [ ] Exhaust smokes, both for boost and for turning
- [ ] Since there is always cheat to simplify confusion of                    [LevelDifficulty]
      Higher difficulty levels will be first person, the world will rotate.
